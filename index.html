      <h1> What Are Wireframes? </h1>
      <p> Wireframes are a drawing/sketch of the basic outline of the webpage you are going to create. It is used to give each member the idea of what the end result should look like, so they are all on the same page. As long as each member follows the wireframe they all agreed on using, there will be less confusion when making the webpage. </p>

      <h1> Git Workflow </h1>
      <p> When in a group with a bunch of other programmers, each member has to have the same code to prevent any issues. A member can push up their code from their own branch using a pull request, where the manager will then look over it and merge it with the master branch if it is all good. Merging is combining the two seperate codes together to form one code with both aspects from each. All the other programmers need to then pull that new code from the master branch to their own branch/code. If they try to merge code that dosent have everything that the master branch has, issues will occure. </p>

      <h1> Ways to Create Responsive Web Design </h1>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li> Using % and em: When givng an elements such 
          as a div a height and width, using percentages instead of px will make that div size change depending on the screen size, making it more responsive. em is usually used for fonts. 1 em is default, but 2 em is 2 times that default size. em can be used on other things as well. Using them both will make your webpage more responsive.
          </li>

          <li> FlexBox: This is a CSS technique that uses a parent div with child divs inside of it. Setting the parent's div display to flex makes it flexible. That allows more flexbox tools to be used such as flex-start and flex-end to arrange the child divs in the parent divs in different ways. 
          </li>

          <li> Media queries: A CSS techniuqe that lets you set a condition such as if the wifth is 500px. If that condition is met, it will allow the other properties that you put inside of the media querie. It basically gives us the ability to make only certain properties activate when a certain condition is met, giving us the ability to make our code more responsive.
          </li>

          <li> Mobile First Development: A tip when designing a web page that will also work on mobile. All you do is create your webpage to fit on mobile devices first, then adding more changes to make it also work on computer webpages. The reason why is because it is easier to make your mobile design more responsive to a webpage design, then from going from webpage to mobile.
